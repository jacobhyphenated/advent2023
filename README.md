# Advent of Code 2023

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/) is a set of small yearly programming problems for a variety of skill levels. They can be solved in any programming language. I used Kotlin with Gradle for this year's project.


### What's Included?
WIP solutions for each day so far
### Running the Code

Clone the repository and run using the local gradle wrapper, or build a jar and run the jar via command line. You'll need to pass arguments to the run command for the day you want to run. You can run multiple days at once.

Examples:
```sh
./gradlew run --args "1"
./gradlew run --args "1 2"
```

Or using a fat jar:
```sh
./gradlew clean build
java -jar ./build/libs/advent2023-0.1.0.jar 1 2
```
